# Musical Director handbook

_aka "How to succeed at MD'ing by actually trying"_

By David Lang

## Introduction

As the Musical Director of a theatrical show, your role is pivotal in ensuring the musical elements of the production come together seamlessly. This handbook serves as a guide of how to be a Musical Director, what is and isn't your responsibility, and summarises the advice I give to prospective MDs that I am mentoring. As such, it is a mixure of hard facts and my own personal opinions/ ways of working.

While mostly written to consumed generally, there are some sub-pages with specific examples for certain musical productions or types or production. These may contain/require specific domain knowledge and will sometimes be irrelevant outside of that domain, but are sometimes also useful as practical examples of my recommendations. Read them at your own discretion.

This handbook is provided as-is, with no guarantees, as a suggestion of how to approach the role, but should provide a helpful starting point for those with less experience. It is up to each of us to choose our own style, using whatever subset of other MDs advice works for us, and be our own MD. At the end of the day, we can't all be David.
